Katana-ds (ds for dork scan) is a simple python tool that automates Google Hacking/Dorking and supports Tor.
It becomes a more powerful in combination with [GHDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)

**Note 25/09/2021** : This Repo is New but the script it self is old back when google dorking was something, i wrote this script back in Highschool during the process of learning how to "scrape" using python and in order to get to use on bs4 and other Python packages and i learned alot of things along, still there's alot of people who use this script... Thanks for 500 ⭐... Oh and OSINT too.


**Note 01/07/2025** : This is a Google Dorking tool I originally wrote around 8 years ago, back when I was just starting to explore scripting, automation, and basic OSINT. I only uploaded it to GitHub a few years later — mostly for fun — not expecting it to gain much attention.

- Fast-forward, and somehow it’s sitting at 1.2k stars. Wild!

Looking back, the code is… let’s say, “educational.” But I’ve decided to leave it up because:

 - It’s a fun reminder of where I started,

- Some folks still find it useful (or nostalgic),

- And honestly? It’s part of the journey.

If you’re just browsing, enjoy the blast from the past! 

I worked on another tool that was inspired by [Tomnomnom's wwww from Nahamcon on how to make your own wordlist](https://tomnomnom.com/talks/wwwww.pdf) if you are into web security and more.
